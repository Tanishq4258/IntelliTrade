# 🤖 IntelliTrade – AI-Powered Trading Assistant (Phase 1)

**IntelliTrade** is a personal long-term project aimed at building a smart AI-based trading assistant.  
The vision is to create a system that can learn from stock charts and financial news to make intelligent, automated trading decisions — fully hands-free.

This is **Phase 1**, where the focus is on:
- Fetching live stock market data (Indian & Global)
- Visualizing it in clean, user-friendly graphs
- Allowing interactive input from the user

## 🚀 Features So Far

- ✅ Fetches **live stock data** using `yfinance`
- ✅ Accepts **user input** for stock symbols (e.g., `AAPL`, `SUZLON.NS`)
- ✅ Plots last 30 days of **closing prices** as a line graph using `matplotlib`
- ✅ Clear, beginner-friendly Python code with full documentation
